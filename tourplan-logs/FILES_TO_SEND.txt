HOW TO SEND:
============

Option 1: ZIP Archive
- Create a ZIP file with all the XML files and reports
- Attach to email along with the main text

Option 2: Inline Key Examples
- Paste the main email text (COMPLETE_EMAIL_WITH_ALL_ISSUES.txt)
- Attach the most critical XML files:
  * 01_accommodation_request.xml & 01_accommodation_response.xml
  * A cruise booking XML pair (if you have one from actual booking attempts)
  * A rail booking XML pair (if you have one from actual booking attempts)
  * 04_rail_rovos_specific_request.xml & response (shows individual product lookup works)

Option 3: Cloud Link
- Upload all files to a shared folder (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Include link in email for TourPlan to access all logs

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

1. The critical files are:
   - Accommodation request/response showing empty results
   - Rail/Cruise showing ButtonName searches return empty
   - Specific product lookup showing individual products work

2. If you have actual booking attempt logs for cruise/rail showing Status="NO", include those as they're the most important evidence of the booking issue.

3. The test reports from today (test-2025-08-07T08-07-39) provide strong evidence that we've tested thoroughly.

4. Make sure to emphasize in the email that these are LIVE PRODUCTION ISSUES affecting real customers.
