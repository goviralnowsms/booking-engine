      fullText: "Hi Patrick I just wanted to say a huge thank you to you and the team at this is Africa for putting together the honeymoon of a lifetime for Emile and I. We had the most incredible timeâ€”every destination you recommended was beyond beautiful, the hotels were absolutely stunning, and the safaris were truly out of this world. Each experience felt so thoughtfully chosen, and the whole trip ran so seamlessly from start to finish. Africa completely stole our hearts. We've come home with memories that we'll treasure forever, and a deep love for the places, the culture, and the spirit of the continent. I've now made all my friends and family incredibly jealousâ€”everyone wants to go to Africa after hearing about our trip! So I'll definitely be sending them your way for some amazing recommendations. Thank you again for making it all so special. We truly couldn't have asked for a more perfect start to our married life ðŸ™‚ Stephanie and Emile",

      fullText: "Some feedback, as discussed, about the recent Tanzania safari you organised for usâ€¦You promised to get us a good driver/guide and you certainly achieved that! Our driver/guide, Emanuel Manga, was excellent with a deep knowledge and passion for the landscape, wildlife and animal behaviour as well as John's needs for photography/videography. I would have no hesitation in recommending himâ€¦The Ang'ata camps were very comfortable and quite luxurious, but at the same time casual and relaxed. A nice balance for us and many Australians I would think. Everything felt fresh and clean and in a good state of repair at all the Ang'ata camps at Ngorongoro Crater, Central Serengeti and Ndutu (mobile camp). Anga'ata staff were, without exception, friendly, cheerful and welcoming. They are to be commended. The chefs do an amazing job in such remote locations, hours from the nearest market...The Miracle Balloon was fabulous, a really special experience, followed by champagne and a bountiful breakfast - once again far more food than we could eatâ€¦Nikki, from John and I, thank you to you and your team very much for organising our Tanzania safari for us. You did a wonderful job, meeting our brief exactly.",

The safari guide Christopher was really great, he had a wonderful sense of humour and was very knowledgeable. He definitely knew where to find the animals. The Sopa Lodges far exceeded my expectations, and the buffet food was exceptional every single day, I can't stop thinking about it! All the Kenyan people and guides were incredibly friendly, and all had a great sense of humour. I truly have nothing but praise for the whole tour and the country. I'm not sure I have another long flight left in me to Africa, but if I do, I would love to use your company again. Thank you once again for your time and effort and lovely approachable nature. Thank you also for staying in touch with flight updates, it was very much appreciated. Kind regards Lorraine",

      fullText: "I find it hard to put into words how epic spectacular our trip was! To tell the full story, we had originally thought we were going to plan a Europe trip. But after multiple failed attempts trying to get an agent to help us, we switched gears and decided to reach out to Africa travel agents. We put out a few emails to google-searched companies, and Nikki was the ONLY one to respond to us. From the very beginning, Nikki was attentive to our needs. We told her what the budget was, what the time frame was, and the type of experience we were looking for. She put together an itinerary for us, and the plan was in place! She responded to every concern we had, answered every email in detail, and took every phone call (at length sometimes!). In addition, we never actually attended the office or met Nikki in person, so if you are concerned about scams, This is Africa is legit. Now to our actual vacation: Everything went off without a hitch. The attention to detail in the transfers was superb, the places we stayed at were beyond our expectations and dreams! We had moments where we looked at each other and said \"This place is incredible! I want to freeze this moment in time!\" And the animals, oh the animals! It was like we were driving around in Jurassic Park, looking for elephants and giraffes. We definitely saw the big five and so much more! The trackers and guides are absolute experts, knowing every plant, animal, bird, and answering all of our many questions. All in all, we cannot thank Nikki, Von and This is Africa. Please do not hesitate to use their service, they are experts without a doubt! Thank you so much Tiffany and family",

      fullText: "Nikki, we cannot thank you enough for what was the most incredible holiday. On holidays like this you try not to let your expectations run away with you but on this one, we reached and absolutely exceeded all that we had hoped it would be. Our short stint in Cape Town was enough to get us wanting to come back for more. Your recommendation on where to stay was perfect for what we needed. Onto safari we went and there are not enough superlatives to describe our joy and wonder at arriving at Sabi Sabi Bush Lodge. You told us to expect spectacular and it was. Your knowledge in helping us decide where to stay was invaluable. The lodge was nothing short of exceptional and service from the staff beyond fault, but that was nothing compared to the actual game drives with our knowledgeable tracker and ranger who I would recommend 100 times over. I think we were lucky enough to view 4 of the big 5 in our first 2 days â€“ every day had something different â€“ and up close â€“ closer than we probably thought possible. We all now have a deep love and appreciation of the African Savannah. Our Mauritius leg was just as wonderous â€“ what a truly beautiful island paradise. Your assistance with all our accommodation, transfers and flights was so helpful and we travelled without hiccup. After the holiday and experiences we had, I would gladly recommend you to anyone! Thank you Deanne",

      fullText: "What an incredible trip. It really did exceed our expectations. There were so many highlights From day one all transfers and all tours went to clockwork. Everyone was so friendly, professional and helpful. We stayed in a variety hotels and tents and all were clean and comfortable. Among the many highlights were the tented camps. The tents were spacious and so comfortable. The food was delicious. Nothing was too much trouble for the fantastic staff. They went above and beyond to ensure our stay was comfortable and an unforgettable experience. The farewell song was the icing on the cake. All this in the middle of the Serengeti; it was extraordinary. The game drives were so exciting. Every day was filled with multiple sightings of all the animals we came to see. We were so close to prides of lions, herds of elephants, zebras and giraffes. We had to pinch ourselves. The guides were amazing, so knowledgeable and informative. No two days were the same. By the end of our trip we became expert spotters of creatures great and small. Thank you Pat, for arranging an incredible itinerary and giving us such a unique experience. We'll definitely recommend This Is Africa to anyone travelling to Africa. Thank you, Anthony and Louise",

      fullText: "Well, a beyond amazing adventure! The trip absolutely exceeded all my expectations â€“ and that's saying something given how great the east African safari was a few years ago. The trip had everything: the Rovos train trip, Cape Town, the self-drive, the mountains, the coast, the Panorama Route, Victoria Falls, the river cruise and the safaris! The lodge in Thornybush Game Reserve with our open to the wild deck (outdoor bathroom had an electric fence!), the Chobe River cruiseâ€¦Savuti in the Kalahari with so many lions, Xugana Island in the Okavango and our lodge near the Makgadikgadi Pans with The Hide (viewing platform accessed by way of a tunnel where you get really close to the animals). I even loved all the flights in tiny aircraft. Great fun. And loved landing on a sand airstrip, engine still running to see a sign \"Welcome to Savute International Airport, departure gate 3 â€“ in the middle of nowhere!) The animals were amazing. We were lucky to see a baby rhino, a just born giraffe with the umbilical cord still attached, lion cubs (heaps), heaps of baby elephants, 3 leopards (previously only seen them asleep in trees. This time they were all out hunting), painted dogs, jackals making a kill, lions feeding on a kudu kill, crocodiles feeding on a buffalo, giraffes, elephants and hippos all fighting. We saw so many elephant river crossings. Nightly sundowners on safari made every fantastic sunset even more memorable! Loved it all! Jaquie and Rod",

I want to say thank you so very much - it was everything I'd hoped it would be and more! It was seamless and just perfect.

The Trackers were amazing and so interesting and the service was truly incredible......everywhere.

      fullText: "We first booked this trip in early 2020 but unfortunately due to Covid's interference it took us three attempts to finally get to Africa. This Is Africa were excellent in ensuring we did not lose out on our deposits and prepaid flights and were very helpful in re planning and booking our itinerary as needed. Many thanks to Nikki and all the This is Africa staff. Our travels started in Tanzania where our seven day Simba Safari trip exceeded our expectations â€“ fantastic animal sightings, excellent accommodation & food options and extremely friendly & helpful staff. Met some wonderful people to share our experiences with and hopefully to see again on our future travels. Victoria Falls is definitely worth visiting and Ilala Lodge a great place to stay at. If you have the time & money a helicopter ride over the Falls is a must do to really experience the grandeur. The cultural dinner at the Victoria Falls Hotel was a must as well to not only see the view but step back into a time of colonial surroundings in the beauty of the Hotel. At Sabi Sands we stayed at Arathusa Safari Lodge in one of their bush facing suites. Luckily Federal Air Charters provide an easy & professional access option to the lodge with a charter flight from Johannesburg to the Arathusa Lodge airstrip. The lodge and surrounding grounds are gorgeous, the staff & food excellent, and the game drives superb with lots of close up encounters with animals including those who chose to wander through the grounds of the lodge itself. For us this was the highlight of our travels. All up â€“ a brilliant holiday seeing lots and lots of animals in their native environments. Again thank you This is Africa for your help & suggestions in finalising our itinerary with a very special thank you to Nikki for helping us with every part of our planning. Regards Gary & Sharon.",

      fullText: "WOW!! I can't thank This Is Africa enough! I have just returned from a 9 day safari through Zimbabwe and Botswana and it completely blew my mind. The whole trip was seamless from start to end due to the amazing team putting together a fab itinerary giving us a bit of everything. We stayed at some of the most beautiful properties on private concessions, and on the water so we got to see all of the animals we wanted providing land and water based experiences and even got to visit a local village and school. The guides used were all so knowledgeable, excellent spotters, super friendly and really helped us to understand Africa better as a whole. For anyone wanting to have an authentic Africa experience This Is Africa is the way to go!",

Each guide was knowledgeable and provided an exciting and engaging game drive. One a day is never enough!
