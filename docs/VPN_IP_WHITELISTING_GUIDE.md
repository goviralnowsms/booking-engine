# 🌐 VPN & IP Whitelisting Guide for Tourplan API

## 🚨 Critical Issue: VPN vs Static IP Conflict

### The Problem
You have a **static IP address** that is whitelisted with Tourplan, but connecting to a VPN (especially South Africa) will **change your IP address** and cause you to lose access to the Tourplan API.

### Current Situation
- ✅ Your static IP is whitelisted with Tourplan
- ❌ Connecting to South Africa VPN changes your IP
- ❌ Changed IP = Lost API access

## 🎯 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Request South African Static IP (Recommended)
**Contact NordVPN Support:**
1. Explain you need your static IP changed to a South African location
2. Provide your current static IP details
3. Request the new SA static IP be whitelisted with Tourplan
4. Update your Tourplan configuration with the new IP

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Maintains static IP (consistent access)
- ✅ South African location (if required by Tourplan)
- ✅ No connection issues

### Option 2: Keep Current Static IP (Easiest)
**If your current IP works:**
1. Continue using your current static IP
2. Do NOT connect to South Africa VPN
3. Test API access with current setup

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No changes needed
- ✅ Immediate testing capability
- ✅ No VPN complications

### Option 3: Request Additional IP Whitelisting
**Contact Tourplan:**
1. Ask them to whitelist your current static IP (if not already done)
2. Explain your testing requirements
3. Request confirmation of whitelisted IPs

## 🧪 Testing Your Current Setup

### Step 1: Check Your Current IP
```bash
python verify_ip.py
```

### Step 2: Test API Connectivity
```bash
python test_tourplan_api.py
```

### Step 3: Use Web Dashboard
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api-testing`

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Connect to South Africa VPN
- This will change your IP address
- You'll lose access to Tourplan API
- Your static IP whitelisting becomes useless

### ❌ Don't Use Regular VPN Servers
- Only use your static IP
- Regular VPN servers have dynamic IPs
- Dynamic IPs are not whitelisted

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If API Calls Fail:
1. **Check your current IP:** `python verify_ip.py`
2. **Verify it matches your static IP**
3. **Ensure no VPN is connected**
4. **Test with mock data first:** Set `USE_MOCKS=true`

### If You Need South African IP:
1. **Contact NordVPN support**
2. **Request static IP change to South Africa**
3. **Get new IP whitelisted with Tourplan**
4. **Update your configuration**
