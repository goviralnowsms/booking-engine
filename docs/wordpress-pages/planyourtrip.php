                  <h1>Plan ahead</h1>
                  <p>Travelling to Africa requires planning ahead. You will usually need to consider matters such as visas and inoculations along with your actual travel itself. We suggest that you book early to allow us to offer you the best options and to gain any benefits from airfares and offers made by our suppliers.

                    Once you inform us of your travel requirements a verbal or written quote will be given to you. Please accept this as a guide only as it may change upon confirmation of your reservation as a result of availability and inclusions. </p>

					<h1>Deposit</h1>
                  <p>To confirm your booking a non-refundable deposit of 30% of the total value of your booking, or full payment if booked within 60 days of departure, and a completed booking form if required by our supplier, must be received by ourselves. Your payment will be taken as an understanding by ourselves that all clients on the booking have checked their travel arrangements and agree to the applicable terms and conditions. Please note that on occasion we may need to vary deposits and full payment regulations due to contractual obligations with Airlines and Suppliers. These will be stipulated at the time of booking.

Your balance of payment is due 60 days prior to departure unless otherwise advised upon booking. We reserve the right to treat any arrangements as being cancelled by yourself if we do not receive such payment on the due date.</p>

				<h1>Credit card fees</h1>
                  <p>Credit card service fees will be applied to the total amount paid as follows: MasterCard or Visa – 2%, American Express – 3%. This fee is non-refundable.</p>
				  <h1>Late fees</h1>
                  <p>Out of courtesy we do not charge a late booking fee or minimum booking value fee. However any booking request made within any relevant supplier's cancellation period cannot be processed until full payment has been received. If a late booking fee is charged by our supplier we will need to pass this onto yourself.</p>
				   <h1>Allow plenty of time</h1>
                  <p>Booking travel arrangements for Africa can be a lengthy process as ‘African time’ is not always as immediate as Australian time. Once you arrive in Africa and understand that this is actually part of the continents appeal you’ll realise that your patience was well worth it.</p>

				   <h1>Making payments to This is Africae</h1>
                  <p>Please choose from one of the following options when making payments.</p>
				  <h6>Direct bank deposit</h6>
				  <ul class="bank-deposite">
				     <li>If you would like to deposit your payment directly into our bank account please use the following details</li>
					 <li>National Australia Bank</li>
					 <li>Account Name: Latitude Marketing</li>
					 <li>Branch Number: 082-140</li>
					 <li>Account Number: 75-035-0827</li>
				  </ul>
				   <h6>Credit card payments</h6>
				   <p>Please complete and email or fax the credit card authorisation form to our Sydney office if paying by Visa, MasterCard or American express. Please note that a credit card fee is applicable as listed above.</p>

				    <h6>Cheque</h6>
				   <p>Please make all cheques payable to Latitude Travel Marketing and post to 34 Macpherson Street, Bronte NSW 2024</p>

                  <h1>Visas allow you to proceed to and cross borders between countries. </h1>
                  <p>Visa requirements vary depending on your nationality and the countries through which you travel. While it is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct documentation, we can advise you about up-to-date visa requirements. </p>
					<h6>Credit card payments</h6>
				   <ul class="bank-deposite">
				     <li>You will need at least six months validity in your passport from your return date to re-enter Australia.</li>
					 <li>African border guards love to stamp passports so make sure that you have plenty of empty pages in your passport if you are travelling through several countries.</li>
					 <li>Always provide us with your name as it appears in your passport when booking, especially if we are booking flights.</li>
					 <li>In most cases it is easy to obtain visas at borders in Africa and it's usually much cheaper. You will need to pay for them in American dollars so make sure you have plenty of good quality US notes printed from 2006 - faded or tatty notes may not be accepted.</li>

                  <h1>Where do I start?</h1>
                  <p>Planning a trip to Africa takes time. First think about what you want to see or do most and find out the best time to experience it. That process will highlight when it's best for you to travel. Next, consider your budget and what style of travel suits you best (options are outlined below). In your planning you will also need an appreciation for distances as Africa is the world's second largest continent and travelling around it takes time.

Call us to discuss your 'wish list' and we will advise you on when best to travel and what options you should consider. We are the experts when it comes to travel times, distances, cost guides and what to expect on safari. We understand that planning a trip to Africa may seem daunting but with our extensive knowledge of the region we will prepare the perfect itinerary to suit your wishes. We’ll plan a trip that has you travelling at a reasonable pace without spending all your time in a vehicle or at airports. We’ll make sure that you get the most from your trip by considering your wish list, budget, requirements and restrictions. </p>

					<h1>What style of travel should I choose?</h1>
					<h2>Tailor-made trips </h2>
                  <p>Tailor-made tours are personalised and offer great flexibility. As opposed to group travel, private tours allow you to travel alone or with your own party. Set itineraries are available which you can customise to suit your own individual interests and needs, or we can compile an itinerary for you from start to finish. Tours are escorted by an English speaking driver-guide in a private vehicle. Tailor-made tours allow for your choices of interest, accommodation and modes of transport and you can decide how long you stay at each destination. Because you have your own driver and vehicle you can be more spontaneous and stop at the local village or craft market en route if time permits. </p>

				<h1>Scheduled group tours</h1>
                  <p>These tours depart on set dates, they have pre-planned itineraries and involve you travelling with a group of people. Scheduled tours are great value as tour operators can spread the cost of running the tour over a group of people. Accommodation can range from five star lodges and basic cabins, to camping, and tours can range from two to 73 days duration. This style of touring allows you to stretch your budget further but you are restricted to a pre-planned itinerary which offers little flexibility. </p>

				  <h1>Overland expeditions</h1>
                  <p>Overland tours are about spending your days experiencing the sights and delights of Africa, and your evenings relaxing around the campfire with fellow travellers. Travelling with a group means you can share your African experience with others and it gives you the opportunity to share the cost of extra activities which you may not have been able to afford on your own. This style of travel is ideal for travellers who want to cover great distances over long periods of time with a limited budget. If you are a solo traveller toverlanding allows you to stretch your budget further by sharing a room, or tent, and a vehicle.</p>
				   <h1>Backpacking</h1>
                  <p>It is possible to backpack in Africa but you need time on your side, a lot of patience and a great sense of humour to enjoy it. Many backpackers in Africa start off with a short overlanding or small group scheduled tour to get a feel for the region. This applies especially in east Africa where you need a way to travel around secluded game parks and obtaining gorilla permits, for example, are easier through an organised channel.</p>

				   <h1>Self-drive</h1>
                  <p>Self-drive holidays are popular in South Africa and Namibia with numerous car hire depots and hotels available. Both countries have sealed roads and highways, road signs are in English and vehicles travel on the left-hand side of the road making driving easy and enjoyable. You can simply hire a car and go with the flow, or choose to pre-book your accommodation and use a map or GPS to locate your hotel. Always consider school holiday periods if self-driving as the locals in these countries are big domestic travellers.

Road surfaces in Africa vary from excellent sealed highways to eroded dirt tracks which include river crossings. Be aware that web-based directions may not be reliable and that border crossings which appear on maps may be closed and roads may be blocked during the rainy season. African border guards love paperwork so your patience will be required if you’re driving between countries.</p>
				  <h6>Scheduled flights</h6>
				  <p></p>
				   <h6>Credit card payments</h6>
				   <p>Most countries in Africa have a national airline and occasionally a second airline in wealthier  countries. Because most Africans can’t afford to go on many holidays there isn’t necessarily a great demand for flights so you might find that flights can be irregular.</p>

				    <h6>Charter flights</h6>
				   <p>Charter flights service private lodges in some areas of the Kruger National Park in South Africa and island lodges in the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Small aircraft access these properties by landing at the lodge's airstrip or at a local airport which they operate. We can advise you on the various options available to get to your accommodation so that your holiday time is maximized fully and you don't spend unnecessary hours sitting at airports or on long, uncomfortable drives.</p>

						 <p>Africa is a year round destination but like any continent with a length of 8000km it encompasses many climate zones.  We’ve listed some of the most popular countries and their climates to assist you in planning your journey.<p>
					  </div>
					  <div class="col-md-6 left-plan">
					     <h2>East Africa</h2>
						 <h4>Kenya</h4>
						<p>Offering a combination of great game viewing and coastal resorts Kenya is popular all year round.
						<strong>The coast</strong> - The Europeans leave their cold winter and migrate south to its warmer climate making it traditionally busier on the coast between Dec – Mar but don’t let that put you off.
						<strong>Game viewing</strong> - The ultimate game viewing experience happens here between July and September when around 2.5 million animals head north to the Maasai Mara seeking its green pastures during the great migration. Book early to get your spot especially if you want to see this event from the comfort of your balcony at one of the privileged game lodges situated at the Mara River bend.
						<strong>Rains versus dry</strong> – The main rains can make access to some lodges difficult in April / May with the gentle rains of November / December creating a greener landscape making areas like the Mountains of the Moon even more picturesque.
						</p>
					  </div>
					  <div class="landscape"><h1>Tanzania</h1>
					  <p>Along with Kenya Tanzania is East Africa’s game viewing capital. Its vast plains lead into its highlands which can be cool at night but the majority of its days are warm and sunny.
					  <strong>Game viewing </strong> –  In May the herds of Zebra and Wildebeest that make up the migration start to move westward from  its eastern plains and enter Kenya making May – July the opportune time and through to September a good time to view this spectacle.  Don’t expect to be alone but do expect to be amazed.
					   <strong>Rains versus dry </strong>– The main rainy seasons are similar to Kenya with the shorter grasses of the dry season from June to October making animals easier to view. Especially the big cats for which parks in Tanzania are famous for.</p>
					  </div>
					   <div class="col-md-6 right-plan">
					     <img src="images/thisisafrica_12624313.jpg">
						</div>
					  <div class="col-md-6 left-plan">
					     <h2>Uganda</h2>
						 <h4>Kenya</h4>
						<p>Offering much lusher vegetation than its eastern neighbours Uganda is a nation full of jungles, lakes and mountains. The rains here between March and May and again in November only add to its beauty and fill its rivers making adventure activities even more extreme.
						<strong>The Gorillas and other primates</strong> – They aren’t called Mountains Gorillas for nothing. Living around 2000 metres and upwards the Gorillas inhabit forested regions that are covered in mist and attract plenty of rainfall. Avoiding the rainy season isn’t essential as visits can be made year round.
