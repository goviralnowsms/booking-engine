# AWS EC2 Setup Guide for Tourplan Booking Engine

This guide helps you set up your AWS EC2 instance to work with the Tourplan API using the whitelisted IP address.

## Overview

- **Your Local IP**: 110.175.119.93 (for SSH access)
- **Whitelisted IP**: 13.210.224.119 (for Tourplan API)
- **Goal**: SSH from local â†’ EC2 instance â†’ Tourplan API

## Quick Setup

### 1. Configure Security Group
\`\`\`bash
# Add your local IP for SSH access
bash scripts/setup-ec2-security-group.sh
\`\`\`

### 2. Associate Whitelisted IP
\`\`\`bash
# Associate the whitelisted Elastic IP with your instance
bash scripts/associate-elastic-ip.sh
\`\`\`

### 3. Connect to Instance
\`\`\`bash
# Helper script to connect via SSH
bash scripts/connect-to-ec2.sh
\`\`\`

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Security Group Configuration

Your EC2 instance needs to allow:
- SSH (port 22) from your local IP: 110.175.119.93
- HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (for web traffic)
- HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere (for web traffic)
- Port 3000 from your local IP (for development)

\`\`\`bash
# Run the security group setup script
bash scripts/setup-ec2-security-group.sh
\`\`\`

This script will:
- Find your EC2 instance
- Add SSH rule for your local IP
- Add web traffic rules
- Show current security group configuration

### Step 2: Elastic IP Association

The Tourplan API requires requests to come from IP 13.210.224.119. You need to associate this Elastic IP with your EC2 instance.

\`\`\`bash
# Run the Elastic IP association script
bash scripts/associate-elastic-ip.sh
\`\`\`

This script will:
- Find the Elastic IP 13.210.224.119
- Associate it with your chosen EC2 instance
- Verify the association worked

### Step 3: SSH Connection

Once the security group and Elastic IP are configured:

\`\`\`bash
# Use the connection helper
bash scripts/connect-to-ec2.sh
\`\`\`

Or connect manually:
\`\`\`bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@13.210.224.119
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Deploy Application

Once connected to your EC2 instance:

\`\`\`bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tourplan-booking-engine.git
cd tourplan-booking-engine

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start the application
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Verification

### Check IP Status
\`\`\`bash
# From your EC2 instance, check the API endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/check-ip-status
\`\`\`

### Test Tourplan Connection
\`\`\`bash
# Test the Tourplan API directly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-tourplan
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Connection Issues

**Problem**: Can't SSH to the instance
**Solutions**:
1. Check security group allows SSH from 110.175.119.93
2. Verify key file permissions: `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/your-key.pem`
3. Confirm instance is running
4. Try using the instance's public DNS name instead of IP

### Elastic IP Issues

**Problem**: Can't associate the whitelisted IP
**Solutions**:
1. Check if IP exists in AWS Console â†’ EC2 â†’ Elastic IPs
2. Verify you're in the correct AWS region
3. Check if IP is associated with another instance
4. Contact AWS support if IP was released

### API Connection Issues

**Problem**: Tourplan API returns errors
**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're making requests from the whitelisted IP
2. Check environment variables for Tourplan credentials
3. Test network connectivity: `curl https://pa-thisis.nx.tourplan.net`
4. Check Tourplan API documentation for changes

## Network Flow

\`\`\`
Your Computer (110.175.119.93)
    â†“ SSH
EC2 Instance (13.210.224.119)
    â†“ HTTPS
Tourplan API Servers
\`\`\`

## Security Notes

- Your local IP (110.175.119.93) is only used for SSH access
- The whitelisted IP (13.210.224.119) is used for all Tourplan API calls
- Never expose Tourplan credentials in client-side code
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Scripts Reference

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
