Booking System Overview for thisisafrica.com.au — Explained Simply

Here’s how the booking system for your website will work, step-by-step, including what’s possible and what has some limitations based on the Tourplan system and API:
1. Searching for Tours

    Customers visit the website and search for tours.
    The website will show real-time availability and pricing by checking directly with Tourplan’s system.
    This means customers only see tours and dates that are actually available.

2. Booking a Tour

    When a customer selects a tour and fills in their details, the website will:
        Create a booking in Tourplan via their API.
        Add the customer’s details as part of the booking.
    If the customer wants to add extras (like gorilla permits), these can be selected and priced during booking.
    Before finalizing the booking, the system will double-check availability to avoid overbooking.

3. Customer Accounts and Editing Bookings

    Customers can have an account on the website to:
        View their booking details.
        Possibly update some personal information.
    Limitation: Due to how Tourplan manages customer data, some details (especially if linked to a “reusable” customer profile in Tourplan) may not be editable after booking.
    To work around this, the system can create a new passenger record if changes are needed, ensuring flexibility.
    Full integration with Tourplan means all booking updates sync back and forth automatically.

4. Payments

    Deposit Payment: Customers pay a deposit (usually 30% of the total price) at the time of booking.
    Extras Payment: Extras like gorilla permits can be included in the deposit or paid separately.
    Final Payment: The remaining balance is due 2-4 weeks before the trip.
    Important:
        Tourplan recommends that all payment logic (how much to pay, when, and how) is handled on your website, not inside Tourplan.
        This means your website will control payment amounts, schedules, and processing (e.g., via Stripe or another payment gateway).
        After a payment is made, your website will notify Tourplan via their API to update the booking payment status.
    Refunds: These are handled manually outside the system.

5. Automated Payment Reminders

    The system can send automated email reminders to customers 2-4 weeks before their trip to pay the remaining balance.
    This is possible if Tourplan’s cancellation and payment deadlines are set up correctly in their system.
    If not, reminders can still be sent using a semi-automated or manual process managed on your website.

6. Syncing with Tourplan

    All bookings, updates, and payments are synced with Tourplan in real-time via their API.
    This keeps Tourplan’s inventory and bookings up to date, avoiding double bookings or errors.
    Your website acts as the front-end interface, while Tourplan manages the backend tour data and booking records.
