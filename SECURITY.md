# Security Guidelines for Stripe Integration

This document outlines security best practices for handling Stripe API keys and payment processing in this project.

## üîê API Key Security

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables (`.env.local`) for all sensitive data
- Keep separate keys for development, staging, and production environments

### Key Types and Usage

| Key Type | Prefix | Usage | Security Level |
|----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Secret Key | `sk_test_` / `sk_live_` | Server-side only | **CRITICAL** - Never expose |
| Publishable Key | `pk_test_` / `pk_live_` | Client-side safe | **PUBLIC** - Safe to expose |
| Webhook Secret | `whsec_` | Server-side only | **CRITICAL** - Never expose |

### File Security Checklist

- [ ] `.env.local` contains actual API keys (not placeholders)
- [ ] `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No API keys are hardcoded in source files
- [ ] `.env.example` contains only placeholder values
- [ ] Production keys are stored securely (e.g., Vercel environment variables)

## üß™ Development vs Production

### Development Environment
\`\`\`env
# Use test keys for development
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_test_key
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_test_key
\`\`\`

### Production Environment
\`\`\`env
# Use live keys for production
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_live_key
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_live_key
\`\`\`

## üîç Security Validation

Run the security validation script regularly:

\`\`\`bash
npm run validate-stripe
\`\`\`

This script checks:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ Key formats are correct
- ‚úÖ No placeholder values remain
- ‚úÖ Appropriate key types for environment

## üö® Security Incidents

### If API Keys Are Compromised

1. **Immediately** regenerate keys in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update environment variables with new keys
3. Review recent transactions for suspicious activity
4. Check git history to ensure keys weren't committed
5. Rotate any other potentially affected credentials

### Key Rotation Schedule

- **Development keys**: Rotate every 6 months
- **Production keys**: Rotate every 3 months or after team changes
- **Webhook secrets**: Rotate when endpoints change

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

### Webhook Security
- Always verify webhook signatures using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- Use HTTPS endpoints for webhook URLs
- Implement idempotency for webhook handling

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all Stripe API communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Code Security
- Validate all input data before processing
- Implement proper error handling (don't expose sensitive info)
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Regular dependency updates and security audits

## üìã Security Audit Checklist

### Monthly Review
- [ ] Run `npm run validate-stripe`
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded secrets in codebase
- [ ] Review Stripe Dashboard for unusual activity
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoints are secure
- [ ] Update dependencies with security patches

### Quarterly Review
- [ ] Rotate API keys
- [ ] Review team access to Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Audit payment processing logs
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing

## üìû Incident Response

For security incidents:
1. Contact team lead immediately
2. Document the incident
3. Follow the key rotation process
4. Review and update security measures
5. Conduct post-incident review

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, ask for a security review.
